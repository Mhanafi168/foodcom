        <h1>Salmon Nutritional Information</h1>
        <p>Here is the nutritional value of a typical serving of cooked salmon (about 3 ounces or 85 grams):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calories: Approximately 177 calories</li>
            <li>Protein: Around 23 grams</li>
            <li>Fat: About 9 grams (including healthy omega-3 fatty acids)</li>
            <li>Omega-3 fatty acids: Rich source, especially in varieties like wild-caught salmon</li>
            <li>Vitamins and minerals: Salmon is a good source of vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, selenium, and niacin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Salmon is considered a healthy choice due to its high protein content, healthy fats, and abundance of essential nutrients. The omega-3 fatty acids found in salmon are particularly beneficial for heart health, brain function, and reducing inflammation in the body.</p>
        <p>In terms of culinary uses, salmon is incredibly versatile. It can be grilled, baked, broiled, poached, or even eaten raw in dishes like sushi and sashimi. Its rich, flavorful flesh pairs well with a variety of herbs, spices, sauces, and side dishes. Additionally, smoked salmon is a popular choice for appetizers, salads, and sandwiches.</p>
        <p>When it comes to sustainable fishing practices, wild-caught salmon is generally preferred over farmed salmon due to concerns about environmental impact, use of antibiotics and chemicals in farming, and the potential for escaped farmed salmon to interbreed with wild populations. However, there are sustainable farming practices being developed to mitigate these concerns.</p>
        <p>Overall, salmon is not only delicious but also a nutritious addition to a balanced diet!</p>
